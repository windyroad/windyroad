I'm over teams \"doing Agile\" like it involves following a prescribed set of processes with a prescribed set of \"ceremonies\". Just the term \"ceremonies\" should be a <strong>BIG RED</strong> warning sign.</p>\n<p>I've even starting to wonder if faux agile is worse than Waterfall... OK, maybe that's taking it a bit far.</p>\n<p>So if that's faux agile, what's real agile? It's called being <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nimble\">nimble</a>. Full Stop.</p>\n<p>No that's not some new methodology with a whole heap of books, videos, acceditations and conferences.
