It's cool, it's new (from what I can find it was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorns_(company)\">launched by Acorns in 2014</a>) and it's painless.</p>\n<p>It works, because rather than asking you to be disciplined and fight your consumerism, it leverages it. The more you spend, the more you save (or invest).</p>\n<p>In this light, it becomes clear that round-ups are just a specific type a consumption based saving, in the same way that <abbr title=\"Goods and Services Tax\">GST<abbr> and <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> are consumption based taxes. Round-ups work and are effective because of the exact same reasons that GSTs and VATs work and are effective.</p>\n<p>But while round-ups are much better than traditional approaches to saving, they look almost ridiculous in the light of a general consumption based saving approach. For small purchases, the amount saved is a large percentage of the transaction, but for large purchases, the amount saved is miniscule. This is anti-consumerist.</p>\n<p>For a consumption based saving approach to be truly consumerist, the amount saved needs to increase with the amount spent. Spend $10, save $1. Spend $1000, save $100. Pick the percentage you want to save.</p>\n<p>I canâ€™t find anyone offering this type of service at the moment, and some of you will ask why, but to me the more obvious question is when.</p>",
