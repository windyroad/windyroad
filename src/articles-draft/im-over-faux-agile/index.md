OK, I've had enough. I'm over teams "doing Agile" like it involves following a prescribed set of processes with a prescribed set of "ceremonies". Just the term "ceremonies" should be a big red warning sign.

So if that's faux agile, what's real agile? It's called being [nimble](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nimble). Full Stop.

No that's not some new methodology with a whole heap of books, videos, acceditation and conferences. Simply ask yourself, are you and the team you are working with nimble? Or are you a big lumbering hot mess?
