## The planning fallacy

The tendency to underestimate the effort it will take to complete a task.

## Plan continuation bias

The tendency to continue with an original course of action that is no longer viable.

Plan continuation bias often results in (catastrophe)[https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Continuation_Bias#Accidents_and_Incidents], (far more effort being expended)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month], or significant compromises of the objective (scope cutting).

As time goes on, plan continuation bias means you need to spend more and more effort to keep the plan on track rather than delivering value

# Consistency bias

Bias around doing what we say
