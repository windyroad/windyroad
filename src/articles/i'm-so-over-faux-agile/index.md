OK, I've had enough. I'm over teams "doing Agile" like it involves following a prescribed set of processes with a prescribed set of "ceremonies". Just the term "ceremonies" should be a **BIG RED** warning sign.

I've even starting to wonder if faux agile is worse than Waterfall... OK, maybe that's taking it a bit far.

So if that's faux agile, what's real agile? It's called being [nimble](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nimble). Full Stop.

No that's not some new methodology with a whole heap of books, videos, acceditations and conferences. Simply ask yourself, are you nimble and is the the team you are working with nimble? Or are you a big lumbering hot mess?
